    <p>Treading a canyon of butterflies,</p>
    <p>To a lake of soft glass like a dream.</p>
    <p>Her gaze makes me stumble and wonder.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="block block2">
    <p>My heart a halcyon, a promise she redeemed,</p>
    <p>Baring a love that must be shared,</p>
    <p>Born with a trust its kiss will pair.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="block block3">
    <p>Supple hands warm and gentle,</p>
    <p>Yielding, honest, and sentimental.</p>
    <p>The twilight fades into her smile.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="block block4">
    <p>A symphony of whispers in the night,</p>
    <p>Shimmering stars witness our delight.</p>
    <p>The world retreats, leaving us alone,</p>
    <p>Love eternal, in our hearts it's grown.</p>
